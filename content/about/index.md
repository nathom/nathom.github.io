I'm a CS nerd who loves all things programming and math. I got started in [open
source software](https://github.com/nathom) in highschool, and now do ML research.

I completed my B.S. in Computer Engineering from UCSD, and am now doing an M.S. in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Controls. I have interned at Stanford AI Lab, Keysight Technologies, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and Yahoo. I am currently doing Reinforcement Learning research, advised by Professor Xiaolong Wang.
