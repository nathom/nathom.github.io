Welcome to my personal blog. I plan on posting whatever I feel like
posting. Currently, this would look like:

  - Project showcases: if I made something cool, I'll show off

  - Tutorials: if I had trouble finding help on a problem I solved,
    I'll post the solution here

  - Random thoughts: I am a man of many opinions, so some might end up
    here

  - Math stuff: If I find some cool math, I'll put it here in
    $\LaTeX$ so I don't forget about it

Hopefully, it will turn into something interesting as time passes.

Enjoy,

Nathan
